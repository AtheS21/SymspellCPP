// SymSpell: 1 million times faster through Symmetric Delete spelling correction algorithm
//
// The Symmetric Delete spelling correction algorithm reduces the complexity of edit candidate generation and dictionary lookup
// for a given Damerau-Levenshtein distance. It is six orders of magnitude faster and language independent.
// Opposite to other algorithms only deletes are required, no transposes + replaces + inserts.
// Transposes + replaces + inserts of the input term are transformed into deletes of the dictionary term.
// Replaces and inserts are expensive and language dependent: e.g. Chinese has 70,000 Unicode Han characters!
//
// SymSpell supports compound splitting / decompounding of multi-word input strings with three cases:
// 1. mistakenly inserted space into a correct word led to two incorrect terms 
// 2. mistakenly omitted space between two correct words led to one incorrect combined term
// 3. multiple independent input terms with/without spelling errors
